Description: This R package contains the `summed_output()` function which takes a column as a character string storing a vector of numeric values within a dataframe and calculates the sum of the vector. It is designed to help users automate repetitive sum operations based on user-defined variable groupings and filter conditions. This package contains **magrittr** and **rlang** as dependencies to support compatibility with tidy evaluation.
