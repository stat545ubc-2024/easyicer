### Introduction

This vignette is a tutorial on how to seamlessly create incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) analyses, including plots, by making use of all the functions in this package. This package was designed in a pipeline structure so that the end-user could cohesively deploy the package functions in a step-wise manner to arrive at a final cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) with ICER plots. The target domain for this package is health technology and economics, where CEAs are a common tool for evaluating the risk-benefit of new interventions for implementation.
